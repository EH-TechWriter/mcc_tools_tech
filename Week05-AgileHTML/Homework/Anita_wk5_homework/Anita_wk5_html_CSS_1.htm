      <p> Hi Friends,<br><br>This week I want to share what I&#39ve been watching lately. As many of you know, the last few months have been difficult <i>(to say the least)</i>, so what better way to destress than with some good screen viewing.</p>
      <h2>What I&#39ve Been Watching Lately</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Schitt&#39s Creek</li>
      <li>Miranda</li>
      <li>Malcolm in the Middle</li>
      <li>Dark Shadows</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why I&#39m Enjoying These Shows</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>They make me laugh. (Ok, Dark Shadows is a soap, but the production values are so cheap and some of the acting is so bad that you can&#39t help laugh.)</li>
      <li>Great characters.</li>
      <li>Fun storylines; not too heavy.</li>
      <li>I love to laugh out loud.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>(Ok, I&#39ve barely written anything in HTML and this is so tedious. How could people stand doing this all day. Alas, I digress&#8230)</p>

      <p>I'm finding HTML so, so tedious that I don't know if I can go on. I had started to create another table, but then I thought, why? I like this banner of the show images, though. I suppose I should say something about the shows.</p>
      <p>Miranda is a lovely show. Originally produced and aired on the BBC, it's a wacky, British comedy, but not like the really bizarre ones from the 1970&#39s. Miranda stars comedian Miranda Hart. Miranda is like a modern-day Lucille Ball. She and all of the characters in her world are fun and zany. (I can't get over that I have to use this long code just to type an apostrophe. Super annoying.)</p>
      <p>Schitt&#39s Creek stars SCTV alums Eugene Levy and Catherine O&#39Hara as the heads of the wealthy Rose family who lose all of their money and are forced to move to a seedy motel in the small town of Schitt&#39s Creek.</p>
      <p>I never watched Malcolm in the Middle when it airedon FOX originally. My loss. I&#39m watching it with my 12 year old now and it's hilarious. I probably think it&#39s funnier now that I am a parent.</p>
      <p>And finally, Dark Shadows. I watched it when I was in middle school, but came in in the middle. It has low production values, but it&#39s really interesting and very addictive.</p>
      <p>OK, I can't take doing this in HTML anymore. Thank you, developers, whereever you are, who have given us so much easier website contruction software!!</p>
