                    <p>A map style ditamap is just a table of contents. You can add a title, but not
                        much else. You can create a hierarchy of topics.</p>
                    <p>Used with non-PDF content, such as HTML output, or to reuse.</p>

                    <p>Intended for use with books. Bookmaps contain a lot of metadata to create all
                        the front and back matter of a book, such as titles, sub-titles, publisher
                        information, copyright information. You can also add specific references for
                        chapters, appendicies, table of contents, index, and so on.</p>

        <p>There are other styles of maps, but 95% of the time you only work with bookmaps and
            maps.</p>
