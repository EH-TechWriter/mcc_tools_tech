        <p class="shortdesc">Once you have completed Data Screens in Acme Eye, complete Selection Screens,
        including Executive Summary. Selection Screens allow you to make selections from Acme Eye
        database and include them in the document you are creating. Your selections tailor the
        document to your client's specific needs. Directions at the top of the screen help identify
        the type of selections you are making and their purpose. You make selections by checking a
        checkbox.</p>
