        <p>Using simple techniques will help achieve the perfect steak.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring Steaks to room temperature prior to cooking. Simply set them on the counter a couple of hours before cooking.</li>
            <li>Make certain steaks are dry before cooking, which will help achieve a better sear.</li>
            <li>Properly salt steaks, with kosher salt, ahead of cooking, and ideally the day before cooking, which will absorb the salt and season them internally. Just before searing salt the outside of the steaks too.</li>
            <li>Let steaks rest for 10 minutes after cooking, which will help retain juiciness while the steaks continue to cook with carry-over cooking.</li>
            <li>Use a thermometer to check the temperature of the steaks. Understand the temperature will continue to rise after the steaks are removed from the heat.</li>
        </ul>
