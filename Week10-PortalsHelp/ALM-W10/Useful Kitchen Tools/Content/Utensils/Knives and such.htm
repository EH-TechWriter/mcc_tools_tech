        <h1>Utensils</h1>
        <p>Again, some of the most useful utensils are really underrated and you don't realize how much you need them until you're without them. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Chef's Knife</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Have this as a catch-all knife</li>
            <li>Get a sharpening stone to prevent the knife from becoming dull</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Slotted Spoon</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Have at least one so you can scoop out foods from liquid</li>
            <li>Really helpful for boiling to separate the water from the food</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Ladle</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>For scooping liquids </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Tongs</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>These are a game changer</li>
            <li>Great for turning when frying </li>
            <li>Get one with a nonstick covering so the metal part of the tongs won't be damaged from touching the pan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Whisk</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Important for baking </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Spatula</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Two different kinds: <ul style="list-style-type: circle;"><li>A spatula with a flat surface bent at an angle: used for picking up and moving food around </li><li>Silicone spatula: used for scraping wet foods off the sides of bowls and pans</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Cutting board</h3>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>People usually get one designated for meat and another for everything else </li>
            <li>Make sure it is heavy enough for it to stay on the table while you cut, or that it has some type of grip surface</li>
        </ul>
