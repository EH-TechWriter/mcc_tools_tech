        <h1 style="font-family: Georgia;font-size: 36pt;">The Importance of Kitchen Tools</h1>
        <h4 style="font-family: Georgia;">A personal aside</h4>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia;">The coronavirus pandemic has changed the lives of billions of people all over the world in many different ways. For me, the pandemic caused my unexpected and premature move out of my family home and also ended my yearlong cooking hiatus. Stuck inside and wanting to bridge the gap between my common habit of going out to eat, I&#160;decided to cook elaborate meals and return to the kitchen. But the move into a different house without a collection of common cooking tools I&#160;grew up with at my disposal had made me realize how important it is to have a wide array of utensils and tools for specific tasks. German philosopher Martin Heidegger noted in <u>Being and Time</u> (1927) that there is nothing like the feeling of missing a tool or having it not work properly in the moment you need it. Developing a more serious cooking hobby would require you to collect good quality specific tools for different techniques instead of cutting corners with tools that will not achieve the same effect. </p>
