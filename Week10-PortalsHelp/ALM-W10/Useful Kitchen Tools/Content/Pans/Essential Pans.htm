        <h1>Essential Pans for Stove top cooking</h1>
        <p>There are many different types of pans out there, but here's a reduced list that I&#160;think provides the most versatility</p>
        <h3>Saucepans</h3>

                <p>Saucepans are great for heating up sauces, boiling vegetables, and cooking other small liquid based foods. It's great to have one on hand that's around 2 quarts specifically for small scale cooking for situations where a giant pot would be overkill. </p>

        <h3>Saute pans</h3>

            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
                    <img src="../Resources/saute pan.jpg" />
                </MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Saute pans are great for frying. Choose one that is non stick with a lid. The rimmed sides make it easy to fry foods and move the food around without worrying about anything spilling out. The lid helps for when you want to leave it to simmer.</p>

                <p>Cast iron skillets are extremely durable. They are practically indestructible and reliable, great for cooking meat and creating a colorful seared coating. You can cook something on the stove and transfer them to the oven without the pan being corrupted. They are well worth the seasoning and cleaning extra steps. </p>
