        <h1>Functionality</h1>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Currently, FOH staff's ChefWorks bistro apron is 32 inches long, 27.5 inches wide, and weighs 6.2 ounces. It has one pocket in front and two thin cotton side straps that tie around the waist. The pocket is deep enough for servers to hold their order book, pens, lighter, and wine tool. Other FOH staff, like bussers, use the same pocket for holding towels and other items. FOH staff complains that loose threads on the pocket stitching on the ChefWorks bistro apron has made the pocket unusable. What's more, the thin ties that wrap around the waist have come untied during busy shifts. Even worse, the ties have broken off at times, making the aprons entirely unusable. </span>

        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">The Cayson Designs bistro apron, however, offers superior functionality, in that it has two front pockets, as well as a side towel loop, which is useful for both servers and bussers. This apron, measuring 36 inches, is longer than the ChefWorks apron, but not quite as wide, at 26 inches. However, a front split in the Cayson Designs apron offers more mobility for FOH staff. The cotton webbing straps offer better security as an apron with clips, rather than ties, around the waist. That is, this apron cannot come untied during a busy night. This apron's denim is a bulkier material than ChefWorks' light cotton, but the superior usability and durability of the Cayson Designs bistro apron cannot be overlooked.</span>

        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">The success of Webber Restaurants over the years indicate that their best and busiest nights are yet to come. When the FOH staff has the most useful tools at their disposal, they are guaranteed successful shifts, night after night. Therefore, Webber Restaurants should outfit its FOH employees with Cayson Design's superior bistro aprons.</span>
