        <h2 class="Heading2_1">Cost</h2>
        <p class="p_1">Servers must pay for their own aprons at Webber Restaurants. </p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">The ChefWorks cotton bistro aprons that they now use cost much less at $13.99 per apron, than Cayson Design's bistro apron in denim, which costs $30.00. However, full-time FOH staff report that they replace their current ChefWorks aprons an average of once every two months, costing them a total of almost $80 per year. A thicker Cayson Design's denim apron, on the other hand, made with quality materials, will last longer than the current ChefWorks aprons, costing the staff less money over time. </span>

        <p class="p_1">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Webber Restaurant's FOH staff indicate they would not mind paying for a higher cost apron, like one from Cayson Design, if they can avoid the hassle of replacing their apron on a regular basis. What's more, a nicer apron gives them a more polished look. When FOH staff feel good about their professional appearance, they can make more money, which is good for both them and Webber Restaurants. The current ChefWorks bistro aprons tend to fade and fray over time, causing a slovenly appearance, which can lower staff morale, and by extension, the money they bring in.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_1">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Webber Restaurants belong to a fine-dining class of restaurants in the Merrimack Valley area, and their prices, product quality, and service style reflect that. Therefore, the professional appearance of their FOH staff should exemplify those same standards. </span>
