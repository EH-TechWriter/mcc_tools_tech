        <h1>Ethics</h1>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Cayson Designs is a family-owned business, specializing in providing restaurants with high-quality uniforms and aprons that are hand-sewn in their San Francisco factory. Cayson has employed the same exclusive custom, high-quality fabric sources for decades, indicating they do not compromise their standards by looking for lower-priced fabrics elsewhere. Lynette Cayson, a founding member, works closely with company president Katie LaMountain, to ensure that the team doesn't lose Cayson's original vision of providing clients with quality hand-sewn products. Cayson collaborates with local and national chefs and philanthropists like Rachel Aronow and Michael Cramer to create custom designs. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Furthermore, Cayson Designs believes in giving back to their community. Since their inception, they have partnered with several local organizations like Meals on Wheels and Project Open Hands, which provides food for the sick and elderly of San Francisco. Cayson Design's most recent impressive effort involves donating 5% of the sales made from their Rachel Aronow-designed aprons, to the Community Wildfire Relief Fund, helping families affected by the recent California wildfires. </span>

        <p class="p_1">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">ChefWorks, in contrast, is a larger corporation and a more well-known uniform supply company than Cayson, and while they have been in business since the 1960s, there is no mention on their website of their connections to charities, to fabric quality, or to their local community.&#160; </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_1">&#160;</p>
        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Since Webber Restaurants believe in responsible sourcing of products and supporting family businesses, this value system should extend to their FOH apparel, as well. </span>
