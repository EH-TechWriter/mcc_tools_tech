        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">Based on ethics, cost, and functionality, this report illustrates that Webber Restaurants should replace their current FOH staff ChefWorks bistro aprons with Cayson Design's bistro aprons. Webber Restaurants will be sourcing FOH aprons from an ethical and responsible company in the food and beverage industry. Cayson Designs has successfully operated their family-owned factory in San Francisco for over forty years, and their quality aprons are the result of unique collaborations with chefs and philanthropists in the food and beverage industry. Like Webber Restaurants, Cayson Designs has contributed to important social initiatives and community fundraisers, such as Meals on Wheels and Project Open Hands. While cost may initially be an issue for frugal FOH staff members who can purchase a ChefWorks apron cheaper than a Cayson Designs apron, the latter option will last longer. Lastly, the superior functionality of Cayson Designs bistro aprons, which boast two large front pockets, a towel hook, a front vent for easier movement, and cotton webbing ties secured by hooks, will ensure that FOH staff can work busy nights with confidence. Overall, these criteria indicate that Cayson Designs aprons are a better fit for the Webber Restaurant Group.</span>
