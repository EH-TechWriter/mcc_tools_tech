        <p class="p_1"><span class="span_1">For nearly twenty years, the Webber Restaurant Group has prided itself on its responsible choices in obtaining the finest quality product for its business. From sourcing local produce from nearby farms, to buying wine from family-owned vineyards that employ biodynamic and sustainable winegrowing methods, Webber Restaurants believe in making informed, ethical decisions when it comes its hospitality standards. Their restaurants bake their own fresh bread, rather than buying it from a corporate commissary, and all of their sauces and dressings are made in house, rather than purchased from a large grocery store or a restaurant supply company. Their cocktail program uses only craft ingredients that can't be bought in bulk quantities from corporate liquor suppliers. Therefore, shouldn't their Front of House (FOH) uniforms also reflect their belief in supporting not only small and ethically run businesses, but particularly their own food and beverage industry? Since its service staff interacts directly with guests and represents its core values, they should be wearing Cayson Designs aprons, rather than the ChefWorks aprons they now wear.
