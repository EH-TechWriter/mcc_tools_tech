        <h2 class="Heading2">The Beef</h2>
        <p>The classic line, “you get what you pay for” holds true when it comes to purchasing steak. </p>
        <p>There are three grades of beef in the US: prime, choice, and select. If it is in the budget, buy “prime”, which represents the top 3% of US beef, has the most marbling, and is the most expensive. If prime is too expensive or not available purchase “choice”, which is the most widely available grade and has an adequate amount of marbling. Avoid the “select” grade, which has the least amount of marbling and produces a relatively dry and tough steak.</p>
        <p>If possible purchase steak that has been dry aged, which means it has been aged in a controlled environment for weeks, and sometimes months, resulting in a more tender steak with a more intense beef flavor.</p>
        <p>You can, however, age steak safely at home for up to seven days. </p>
