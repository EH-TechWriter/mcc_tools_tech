Meghana Arvind Week 7 Homework
##############################

Here is an H2 heading.
**********************

My first reST project
======================
#. I installed the latest version of Python.
#. I then installed Sphinx through the command prompt.
#. I made an account on Read the Docs.
#. I made a new public GitHub repository for this project - meghana_mcc_read_the_docs.
#. I cloned my new meghana_mcc_read_the_docs repository locally within my Week 7 homework directory.
#. Within the meghana_mcc_read_the_docs repository, I ran sphinx-quickstart to start a new Sphinx project.
#. I made a new reST file and added it to the index.rst file.
#. I committed and pushed my changes to GitHub
