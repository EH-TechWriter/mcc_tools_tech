        <h1>Cuts of Steak</h1>
        <p>The cuts of steaks vary greatly, especially in marbling and tenderness, but also in flavor that is often affected by the cow breed and how it was raised.</p>
        <p>A trusted brand of steaks is Certified Angus Beef&lt;tm&gt;, which is beef from the Angus breed and USDA graded Choice or Prime. Certified Black Angus&lt;tm&gt; requires additional quality specifications to be met related to marbling and tenderness.</p>
