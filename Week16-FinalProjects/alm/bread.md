# Baking bread

Baking bread can be very therapeutic and rewarding. 

To make bread, you need the following:

* Flour
* Liquid
* Salt
* Leavening agent
* Fat (optional)

To get a specific type of bread, you may want to follow an actual recipe. However, you don't have to be precise to get edible bread.

For example, start with:

* 4 cups bread flour (can mix up to 50/50 with wheat flour)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water 
* 2 1/4 tsp yeast
* pinch of sugar

1. Mix together the water, yeast, and sugar. 
   Let rest at least 10 minutes. It should begin to foam.
2. Mix together the flour and salt.
3. Add the yeast liquid to the flour mixture and combine.
   Mix until you have a slightly shaggy ball.
   You may need to add more flour or more water to get to the consistency.
4. Turn the dough out on to a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.
5. Put into a clean bowl and cover with towel and let rest for at least an hour in a warm location. 
   The dough should double in size.
6. Turn out the dough again and knead a bit more. Shape into loaves.
7. Let rise another hour.
8. Bake at 375 for at least 50 minutes.
   The bread should sound hollow when you thump on it.

This is just the start. You can play with different flour combinations, adding different liquids such as milk or beer, adding butter or oil to your dough, etc. to make all different types of breads.
