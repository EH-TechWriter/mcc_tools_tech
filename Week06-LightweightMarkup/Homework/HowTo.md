# How to replace a blown fuse out of your car

Often a device will stop working in your car. Instead of taking it to the mechanic, the problem
is often a fuse that has failed.

1. Open your car user manual
2. Find the fusebox location in the engine bay
3. Open the hood using the hood open latch. *(The latch is usually
   under or near the steering wheel.)*
4. Open the hood using the external hood latch, usually centrally located under where
   the hood touches the bumper.
5. Open the fusebox cover, which usually has a plastic button you need to press to open the cover.
6. On the top of the fusebox cover, there is a guide of which fuse needs to be removed and replaced
7. Use needlenose pliers to carefully pull out the broken fuse.
8. Press the new fuse of the same amperage into the slot.
9. Check the device that is failing to see if it is now working.
