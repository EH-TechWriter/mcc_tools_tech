# Hi Everyone! I am going to the 250th Anniversary of the Boston Massacre on Saturday, March 7, 2020
## It's been a long time since I have seen the reenactment of the Massacre. I think it was 2008.
### Could that have been **TWELVE** years ago?

It seems I am always working when it's time to see something commemorative or historical in Boston! 

Here are some historical reenactment dates and Boston and why I missed them.
|Event				|Date	|Reason		|
|-------------------|:-----:|----------:|
|Boston Tea Party	|Dec 16	|Had to work|
|Boston Massacre    |Mar 5  |Had to work|
|Lexington/Concord  |Apr 17 |Had to work|

As you can see, I work too much and then forget to request off for important historical events.
