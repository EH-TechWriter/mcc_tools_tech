# How to play offense in the game of **baseball**
## America's pasttime (the baseball one) is currently in a *lockout*
### A lockout occurs when the MLB players union and MLB team owners cannot agree on labor issues, such as pensions and player safety concerns.
#### So while we wait for them to get their act together, we're going to describe the steps required to have success on offense

1. Choose a baseball bat that is an appropriate size for your height and swing trajectory. i.e., if you tend to grip the bat towards the barrel, you might opt for a longer one
1. Develop your plate stance, and stick with the same positioning everytime you are at-bat.
1. Wait for your pitch! If a pitcher throws erratically, don't hesitate to take a walk.
1. If you make contact with the baseball, run as fast as you can to the firstbase bag.
1. Await instructions from the firstbase coach regarding whether to advance to the next bag.
1. Practice. Practice. Practice!
