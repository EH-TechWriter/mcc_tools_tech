This week I want to share what I've been watching lately, but this week I'm doing it in **GFM Markdown**. As many of you know, the last few months have been difficult *(to say the least)*, so what better way to destress than with some good screen viewing.

Well that was fun. Use the `<a href>` tag to put the link in. That's fine. **_Now I'll fool with_** a column for a few minutes, then move on to a new "portfolio" type document instead of my tv watching.
