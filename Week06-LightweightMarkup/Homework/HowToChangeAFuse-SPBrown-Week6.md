# <p align="center">How to replace a vehicle fuse</p>


Often a device will stop working in your car. Instead of taking it to the mechanic, the problem is often a fuse that has failed.

1. Open your car user manual. 
   Find the fusebox location and the hood latch release inside the vehicle.
2. Open the hood using the hood open latch. *(The latch is usually
   under or near the steering wheel.)*
3. Open the hood using the external hood latch. The latch is usually in the center of the hood at the bottom, closest to the bumper.
   
4. Open the fusebox cover, which usually has a plastic button you need to press to open the cover.
5. On the top of the fusebox cover, there is a schematic guide that lists the location of each fuse and its function.
6. Use needle-nose pliers to carefully pull out the broken fuse.
7. Carefully press the new fuse (of the same amperage) into the slot.
8. Check the device that is failing to see if it is now working.
