# A Guide to Cooking the Perfect Steak Indoors

With some thoughtful planning, high quality beef, the right equipment, and proper technique, achieving steakhouse quality steaks at home is easily within the home cooks’ abilities.

Quality steak is expensive and after spending up to $30 a pound for dry aged rib eyes, the last thing cooks want to do is cook it wrong and hammer their steaks, cooking them well done when they were shooting for medium rare.

This is a straightforward guide to help avoid common pitfalls and achieve steaks that approach what they serve at Morton’s and The Palm.

## Planning 

The more time available prior to cooking the better. Time allows you to save money by aging the steaks at home, salt the steaks properly, and prepare sauces and sides ahead of time.

## The Beef 

The classic line, “you get what you pay for” holds true when it comes to purchasing steak. 

There are three grades of beef in the US: prime, choice, and select. If it is in the budget, buy “prime”, which represents the top 3% of US beef, has the most marbling, and is the most expensive. If prime is too expensive or not available purchase “choice”, which is the most widely available grade and has an adequate amount of marbling. Avoid the “select” grade, which has the least amount of marbling and produces a relatively dry and tough steak.

If possible purchase steak that has been dry aged, which means it has been aged in a controlled environment for weeks, and sometimes months, resulting in a more tender steak with a more intense beef flavor.

You can, however, age steak safely at home for up to seven days. 

## Equipment 
A cast iron skillet and meat thermometer are the two essential pieces of equipment needed. Both are inexpensive and useful for many other purposes.

## The Techniques 

Using simple techniques will help achieve the perfect steak.
- **Bring steaks to room temperature prior to cooking.** Simply set them on the counter a couple of hours before cooking.
- **Make certain steaks are dry before cooking**, which will help achieve a better sear.
- **Properly salt steaks**, with kosher salt, ahead of cooking, and ideally the day before cooking, which will absorb the salt the steaks and season them internally. Just before searing salt the outside of the steaks too.
- **Let steaks rest for 10 minutes after cooking**, which will help retain juiciness while the steaks continue to cook with carry-over cooking.
- **Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the steaks**. Understand the temperature will continue to rise after the steaks are removed from the heat.
